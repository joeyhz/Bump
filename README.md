# Bump
Joey's Chrome Extension

This is an extension I developed which, when completed, should allow people to make streaming a potentially social experience. When someone is streaming similar content as a friend, they will be alerted to the fact, and given the option to say hi. This simulates bumping into a friend at a common space. If both friends agree to the contact, then a dialogue will open between them.
